# dbt for BigQuery Bootcamp

This project contains a [dbt](https://getdbt.com) project.

dbt is a tool that runs the Transform step of your ELT (Extract-Load-Transform) process. Essentially, you load data into your warehouse (Redshift) with FiveTran or other tools (the EL steps)
and then transform it with dbt.

dbt Concepts:
- Sources
    - These are references to data sources loaded by your EL process
    - Defined in source.yml files (inside models/ subfolders)
- Data
    - These are CSV files that define a mostly static dataset
    - These files live in the data/ folder
    - These are loaded with the `dbt seed` command
- Models
    - These are the bread and butter of dbt
    - These reference sources and other models
    - You are meant to build models on top of models which means you can contain business logic of how data fits together in a single place so that if that piece of logic needs to change it only has to be changed in one place

## Prerequisites

### Install Required Packages

Install Homebrew

Run `mkdir homebrew && curl -L https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tarball/master | tar xz --strip 1 -C homebrew`

Run the following commands in terminal
1. `brew update`
2. `brew install git`
3. `brew tap dbt-labs/dbt` ~ 2 mins
4. `brew install dbt-bigquery` ~ 10-15 mins
5. `brew install --cask google-cloud-sdk` ~ 5-10 mins
6. 
```sh
gcloud auth application-default login \
  --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery,\
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly,\
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/iam.test
```

### Create your profiles.yml
```yml
bigtimedata: #this needs to match your profile in your project.yml
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: bigquery
      method: oauth
      project: big-time-data-project #bigquery project name
      dataset: dbt_rachel #this will be where your locally ran models will show up
      threads: 4
```
The default place to put this file is in `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`

Run the following commands in terminal
1. `vi ~/.dbt/profiles.yml`
2. `i`
3. Paste your profile.yml from above
4. `esc`
5. `:wq`
6. `enter`

Set the DBT_PROFILE_PATH env var
```sh
export DBT_PROFILE_PATH=~/.dbt
```

### Test ability to run dbt
Now you can run dbt locally
```sh
dbt --version
```

Install your dbt dependencies
```sh
dbt deps
```

You can now run all the [dbt CLI commands](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-commands)

Try a dbt run
```sh
dbt run --models dim_date
```
This should successfully run and look similar to
```sh
root@3cc894b68e70:/usr/app# dbt run --models dim_date
Running with dbt=1.1.0
Found 3 models, 10 tests, 0 snapshots, 0 analyses, 487 macros, 0 operations, 1 seed file, 2 sources, 0 exposures, 0 metrics
